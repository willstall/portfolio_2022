# Need to start with something **big and flashy**
- What about showing off works-in-progress of Subtle?
- Could show off a still or video from one of my most recent series? *What series?*

> If you want to stay up to date on my art, I post here on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/willstall)

## Shader Series
Let's show 3 of the series for now

## Articles
> Faqs can easily be articles you write. **Pick 3**
* How do you make what you make?
* What are you working on?
* What did you used to do?
* How can I learn to make shaders too?



# Alternative Strategy for the Homepage. Why not just use what you currently have with a cool ass header?
