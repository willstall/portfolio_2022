# **By day I work at [Cipher Prime](https://www.cipherprime.com)**, Philadelphia's *most* Philly game studio.
	
I started [Cipher Prime](https://www.cipherprime.com) with [Dain Saint](https://www.daintsaint.com) over 10 years ago. *Since then, it has helped me achieve so many dreams.* We've recieved an Apple Hall of Fame Award, Communication Arts Distinction, and quite a few other accolades. I've even had the honor of being in publications like the Inquirer, Wired Magazine, Kotaku, Ars Technica, etc. **Someone even let me put a game on a PS4.**

# **By night**, I'm a *passionate creator* just waiting to backflip into your heart.

## Developer
Ever since I was a 13 year old tot, developing has been one of my biggest hobbies. *Throwing code around has allowed me to create unique experiences* that I couldn't create any other way like our recent art show [We've Traveled So Far](http://www.wevetraveledsofar.com/).

## Designer
I once thought that design was tied directly to graphic design (*whoops*). Now, I subscribe to the theory that *design is in all things*. So, I created [Stupid Desk](http://www.stupiddesk.com/) to show anyone that they might have a little ‘designer’ in them.

## Prototyper
*Life can't always be about the novels*; you have to mix it up with some short stories. I try and create something small once a month, usually at a game jam. Try out [Don't Drop the Baby](https://willstall.github.io/DontDropTheBaby/) or [Trace](https://github.com/willstall/CreateJSScaffold).

If you're interested, grab my [CreateJS Prototyping Scaffolding](https://github.com/willstall/CreateJSScaffold).

## Collaborator
*I truly believe you can only go so far alone.* One of my favorite collaborations was creating [These French Fries are Terrible Hotdogs](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shawnpierre/these-french-fries-are-terrible-hot-dogs-a-card-ga) with [Shawn Pierre](https://twitter.com/ShawnPierre).

P.S. Let's create something together!

## Organizer
In recent years, I was fortunate to co-found [Philly Game Mechanics](http://www.phillygamemechanics.com/), a local organization that helps foster creation. I was even the Creative Director of the [Philly Geek Awards](http://phillygeekawards.com/) there for a few years.

*We have a wonderful community in this city and it deserves all the kudos it can get.*
