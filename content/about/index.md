## Creative Engineer

By Day I work at Cipher Prime, Philadelphia's most Philly game studio.
I started Cipher Prime with Dain Saint over 10 years ago. Since then, it has helped me achieve so many dreams. We've recieved an Apple Hall of Fame Award, Communication Arts Distinction, and quite a few other accolades. I've even had the honor of being in publications like the Inquirer, Wired Magazine, Kotaku, Ars Technica, etc. Someone even let me put a game on a PS4.

By Night, I'm a passionate creator just waiting to backflip into your heart.
Developer
Ever since I was a 13 year old tot, developing has been one of my biggest hobbies. Throwing code around has allowed me to create unique experiences that I couldn't create any other way like our recent art show We've Traveled So Far.

Designer
I once thought that design was tied directly to graphic design (whoops). Now, I subscribe to the theory that design is in all things. So, I created Stupid Desk to show anyone that they might have a little ‘designer’ in them.

Prototyper
Life can't always be about the novels; you have to mix it up with some short stories. I try and create something small once a month, usually at a game jam. Try out Don't Drop the Baby or Trace.

Collaborator
I truly believe you can only go so far alone. One of my favorite collaborations was creating These French Fries are Terrible Hotdogs with Shawn Pierre.

P.S. Let's create something together!

Organizer
In recent years, I was fortunate to co-found Philly Game Mechanics, a local organization that helps foster creation. I was even the Creative Director of the Philly Geek Awards there for a few years.
