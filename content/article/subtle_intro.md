# A Subtle Introduction
It was a friday night; (DATE) to be specific. For a lot of people in the US this was what I'd call a pretty shitty day (I believe this to be an understatement). For me, art in all forms, has been my therapy. The sudden loss of womans' reproductive rights coupled with my own special grade of identity crisis and self doubt was the fuel for the fire that later became the Subtle long-form series.

Almost 3 years ago now, I started creating daily shaders and posting them on my social media. I even published my first [30 Days of Shade](30daysofshade.com) online complete with a real-time editor, source code, and a nice [GitHub]() readme.md for how you too can get started. Learning to create shaders has been one of the most humbling experiences of my life, especially with my limited math abilities at the time. It was so overwhelming, that a few months later I changed my daily posting to a series of 3 pieces a week. These weekly series are usually a combination of tons of experiments new and old. To say I made the Subtle series that Friday would be a vast understatment of years of practice in generative art that ranges all the way back to my Flash days when I initially started in the early 2000's.

13 years ago, I met a friend at a party and created a somewhat small-acclaimed game studio called Cipher Prime. It was an exhilarating and scary time, but I felt very alive. A few years ago, Dain and I made the decision to no longer create games together. It's been a very strange kind of identiy crisis for me since. In many ways, I've been chasing my own shadow and also comparing myself to the legendary things that my business partner and I created at the time. At one point near the end of our studio's life, we did an Art Show called,'[We've Traveled So Far]()' with gorgeous art inspired by our first game Auditorium. I loved this art show and it was something I felt only we could create at the time.

On this particular Friday, in complete melancholy and despair, was the day I challenged myself to be the person I was AGAIN. I needed to know that I wasn't just a shadow of myself, I needed to know I'd grown. I needed to know I still could. I needed to reflect on what had just happened.

Mostly, I needed to create my own world.

# A Subtle Introduction
 Creating art in all forms, has been my therapy. 
 
 It was a friday night; (DATE) to be specific. For a lot of people in the US, this was what I'd call a pretty shitty day (I believe this to be an understatement). The sudden loss of womans' reproductive rights coupled with my own special grade of identity crisis and self doubt was the fuel for the fire that later became the Subtle long-form series.

There are two things that are important to me, people having the right to make choices in their lives and being about to love each other and themselves and creating things that can help others and give back to the world. It was a Friday, a day that many people saw coming, but hit me particularly hard as I was wrapped up in my own identity crisis and struggling with the purpose of my daily efforts.  This self doubt coupled with the sudden loss of this choice for millions of Americans became the fuel for the fire that evolved into the 'Subtle' long-form series.

 In 2008, I met a friend at a party and created a small but acclaimed game studio called Cipher Prime. It was an exhilarating and scary time, but I felt alive and vibrating with creative energy and ambition. A dozen awards, games, and years later, my co-founder Dain and I made the decision to no longer create games together. Near the end of our studio's life, we did an art show called,'[We've Traveled So Far]()' with gorgeous art inspired by our first game 'Auditorium.' I loved this art show and it was something I felt only we could create. Then, as it ended, I was suddenly adrift.  The world I had created for myself professionally was behind me and I was chasing my own shadow and comparing myself to the incredible things that my business partner and I created. I began searching for what could be next.

Three years ago, I started creating daily shaders and posting them on social media. I published my first [30 Days of Shade](30daysofshade.com) online complete with a real-time editor, source code, and a nice [GitHub]() readme.md for how you too can get started creating your own. Learning to create shaders was a humbling experience. Math was never my forte, and with my limited math abilities at the time, it was overwhelming, but after a few months of daily posts, I felt comfortable attempting something a bit more ambitious. Honestly, there was never a moment in my life where I thought, *math will be my paintbrush.*

I changed these daily postings to a series of 3 pieces a week that combined concepts and experiments new and old. The inception of the 'Subtle' series was sparked on that Friday, but is the culmination of years of practice in generative art built on the foundation of my Macromedia Flash days in the early 2000's.

On that particular Friday, in a complete fit of melancholy and despair, I challenged myself to be a version of my old self. I wanted to feel alive again with creative energy and purpose. I needed to know that I wasn't just chasing a shadow, I needed to know that I'd grown. I needed to know I could still make beautiful things. I needed to reflect on what had just happened.

Mostly, I needed to escape create my own world.
