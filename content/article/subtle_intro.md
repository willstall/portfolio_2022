# A Subtle Introduction
It was a friday night; (DATE) to be specific. For a lot of people in the US this was what I'd call a pretty shitty day (I believe this to be an understatement). For me, art in all forms, has been my therapy. The sudden loss of womans' reproductive rights coupled with my own special grade of identity crisis and self doubt was the fuel for the fire that later became the Subtle long-form series.

Almost 3 years ago now, I started creating daily shaders and posting them on my social media. I even published my first [30 Days of Shade](30daysofshade.com) online complete with a real-time editor, source code, and a nice [GitHub]() readme.md for how you too can get started. Learning to create shaders has been one of the most humbling experiences of my life, especially with my limited math abilities at the time. It was so overwhelming, that a few months later I changed my daily posting to a series of 3 pieces a week. These weekly series are usually a combination of tons of experiments new and old. To say I made the Subtle series that Friday would be a vast understatment of years of practice in generative art that ranges all the way back to my Flash days when I initially started in the early 2000's.

13 years ago, I met a friend at a party and created a somewhat small-acclaimed game studio called Cipher Prime. It was an exhilarating and scary time, but I felt very alive. A few years ago, Dain and I made the decision to no longer create games together. It's been a very strange kind of identiy crisis for me since. In many ways, I've been chasing my own shadow and also comparing myself to the legendary things that my business partner and I created at the time. At one point near the end of our studio's life, we did an Art Show called,'[We've Traveled So Far]()' with gorgeous art inspired by our first game Auditorium. I loved this art show and it was something I felt only we could create at the time.

On this particular Friday, in complete melancholy and despair, was the day I challenged myself to be the person I was AGAIN. I needed to know that I wasn't just a shadow of myself, I needed to know I'd grown. I needed to know I still could. I needed to reflect on what had just happened.

Mostly, I needed to create my own world.


## AGAINNNNNN
All people should be considered equal and they should all be allowed active agency on thier own lives.


There are two things that are important to me, people having the right to make choices in their lives and being about to love each other and themselves and creating things that can help others and give back to the world. It was a Friday, a day that many people saw coming, but hit me particularly hard as I was wrapped up in my own identity crisis and struggling with the purpose of my daily efforts.  This self doubt coupled with the sudden loss of this choice for millions of Americans became the fuel for the fire that evolved into the 'Subtle' long-form series.

## Another?
It was a Friday night –(DATE) to be specific. For myself, and an enormous amount of people in the United States, it was a day of mourning. The sudden loss of women’s reproductive rights coupled with my own special grade of identity crisis and self doubt was the fuel for the fire that later became the Subtle long-form series.
