# Elevator Pitch *for a good job*
I'm looking for a company that is product-driven, can challenge me, has a good team, and is at the forefront of technology. 


I'm looking for a company building innovative products where I can tackle challenging problems alongside an world-class team. It's not enough to make a usable product. I need to make a lovable product.

Making usable products is not enough for me. My passion is making lovable products

-'just look for these companies', don't say it. A pure bonus...if this is in the category of games, design, art,shaders, or truly helps of shapes the future.

# Need to start with something **big and flashy**
- ~~What about showing off works-in-progress of Subtle?~~ Show off Subtle in an *'Upcoming'* Section
